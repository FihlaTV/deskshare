This project uses the Xuggler library internally and the version used is licensed as **LGPL**; that being said, it may affect the license of this project as **APL**, but I'm not a lawyer. If the project used **GPL** and you "distribute" it, instead of using it internally you'd be required to make your source available; again, I'm no lawyer.. your mileage may vary.
